SYS:Sure. All members get an invitation to the annual holiday extravaganza with an open bar and free flights from anywhere in the US. Bronze members get reduced shipping fees and promo codes.

SYS:Gold members get all the previous, plus unlimited refunds and benefit of the doubt in any and all transactions.

USR:Thank you. Do any of the levels receive free shipping? I am interested in free shipping because I plan on ordering many things.

<|endoftext|>SYS:Hi, how can I help you today?

USR:I'm thinking of ordering from you, but before I do, I need to know your refund policy.

SYS:Ok, I can help with that

USR:Thanks.

SYS:Your welcome. One moment please

ACT:Searching the FAQ pages ...

ACT:System Action: search policy

SYS:Okay you just want to know our refund policy correct?

USR:Yes.

SYS:Ok great. Refunds are available for items before they have been shipped.

SYS:They can be issued with an Order ID, email, and username

SYS:So it's best to get that information together before contacting us.

SYS:We can help you recover a username if needed though

SYS:Does this answer your question?

USR:Mostly. That means I can't get a refund after something's been shipped?

SYS:After it's been shipped, we technically will just have you return the order instead of refunding it

SYS:So you can still get your money back if you are unhappy

USR:That makes sense. Guess that's all I needed.

USR:Thanks for your help.

ACT:Searching the FAQ pages ...

ACT:System Action: search boots

USR:For the boots by Tommy_Hilfiger that cost $89, how would I remove gum from the sole

SYS:Once the gum kind of melds with the peanut butter, scrape it off. Then clean your shoe with soap and water to get rid of any remaining peanut butter or gum.

USR:Do you have any alternate methods if I do not have peanut butter?

SYS:Peanut butter is the only method that would not void the warranty, I'm sorry.

USR:Okay, thank you.
