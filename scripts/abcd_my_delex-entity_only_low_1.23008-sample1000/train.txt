SYS:Hello David, How can I help you today?

ACT:<SENT_MASK>

USR:Ok, so how complicated is it to cancel a subscription?

SYS:I will be happy to look into that for you.

USR:<SENT_MASK> I should explain. I don't have one yet, but I'm thinking of getting one.

USR:But on other sites I've gotten screwed because I couldn't canel the subscription when I wanted to

SYS:Ok so just to be clear, you don't have one yet but you are wondering if you did have one, how hard would it be to cancel?

USR:<SENT_MASK> exactly!

SYS:I certainly understand that, it is frustrating when you can't cancel a subscription hassle-free.

SYS:With our company, you can easily cancel your subscription. Just contact us and we will be happy to do it. You are not in any contract.

USR:So, I could get a subscription, use it to buy gifts for a bunch of birthdays coming up in my family, and then cancel it in say, 3 months?

SYS:Yes, cancel any time.

USR:Can I do it through chat like this, or do I have to call?

SYS:Whichever you prefer!

USR:That sounds good! Thanks for your help!

SYS:<SENT_MASK>

SYS:Ok, the instructions for removing stains like that are as follows

SYS:wet a cotton cloth and gently dab it on the stained area. Then, sprinkle some salt on the area and let it sit for five minutes or more, absorbing the excess water. Next, pour some boiled water on the area to flush out the stain. Finally, you can laun

SYS:launder the jacket with the hottest water setting to completely remove any residual marks. When drying, either line dry the jacket or use a low-heat dryer.

USR:ok that doesn't sound too bad

USR:so salt won't remove the color>

USR:Hi, I want to find out about gift wrapping my items. Like the cost etc

SYS:I'd be happy to assist you with that.

SYS:Let me check that information for you.

ACT:<SENT_MASK>

ACT:<SENT_MASK>

SYS:Gift wrapping is $4.99 per item. However, it may not be available for oversized items.

SYS:You can add up to 300 characters as a message on your purchase, but must specify a separate message for each item to be gift wrapped, even if it is a repeat.

USR:Is that per address?

SYS:<SENT_MASK>

SYS:It is $4.99 per item purchased, when available.

USR:I have 3 items but they're going to the same address so what would the total be?

SYS:The total for gift wrapping would be $14.97.

USR:I want them wrapped separately

SYS:They will be wrapped separately.

USR:what if they all were wrapped in the same box?

SYS:We only wrap individual items separately.

USR:are you sure? my friend got hers wrapped in the same box and she said it was  cheaper

SYS:I'm afraid we only wrap separately.

USR:can you double check? they did it for her.

USR:can you ask your supervisor?

SYS:I have double checked, and my information shows that it is fixed at $4.99 per item.

SYS:I will escalate this to my manager.

ACT:The manager has been notified.

USR:<SENT_MASK>

SYS:<SENT_MASK>

USR:how will I find out the answer?

SYS:The manager will contact you.

USR:you didn't even ask my name!

USR:how will they notify me?

SYS:I will pull up your account so that it is on record. What is your full name?

USR:<SENT_MASK>

ACT:<SENT_MASK>

SYS:Your account has been pulled up. <SENT_MASK>

USR:what phone number do you have for me?

SYS:I am unable to see that information, but my manager will have access to your full account.

USR:how? <SENT_MASK>

SYS:<MASK> simply means that you do not have a paid membership, but you still have an account in our system.

ACT:<SENT_MASK>

ACT:<SENT_MASK>

ACT:<SENT_MASK>

SYS:Hello, in order to remove a wine stain, we recommend wetting a cottong cloth and dabbing the stain. Next, sprinkle some salt on the area and wait for 5 or more minutes. Next, pour some boiled water on the area, which will flush the stain out. Finally

USR:I want to get an item, but I'm unable to\

USR:as items added to my cart aren't coming up

SYS:<SENT_MASK> I have some quick tricks that often help with website issues, but if none of those work, I should be able to place an order for you manually

SYS:Is it just the shopping-cart section of the site that's giving you trouble today?

USR:yes just that.

SYS:Okay, I know it sounds basic, but sometimes just refreshing the page is enough to get it to work

ACT:<SENT_MASK>

SYS:Is your cart accepting items after reloading the page?

USR:No it doesn't

SYS:<SENT_MASK> One other simple trick is to log out of the website and then log back in. Sometimes that quick reset is all the page needs to start working again

ACT:<SENT_MASK>

USR:Just did

SYS:<SENT_MASK> Is it still giving you the same problem?

USR:same

SYS:I see, well I can probably take your order manually, however just to be sure, is the item that you were looking at currently in stock

USR:are you there

SYS:There might be a message in the lower left corner if it's out of stock. That can be easy to miss on the product page

USR:how did I miss that.

USR:<SENT_MASK>

SYS:Oh, I see. Well at least we've found the problem

USR:<SENT_MASK>

USR:<SENT_MASK>

SYS:<MASK>, can you try logging out of your account and then back in to see if it will accept the card now?

ACT:<SENT_MASK>

USR:<SENT_MASK> <SENT_MASK>

USR:I just logged out and then back in, but my card is still being rejected

SYS:<SENT_MASK> Delete all of the payment information and then enter it in again. Let me know what happens.

ACT:<SENT_MASK>

USR:Okay give me a moment

USR:That didn't work either!! <SENT_MASK>

SYS:<SENT_MASK> Take a look at your credit card and check the expiration date. It may have expired.

USR:Okay....

ACT:<SENT_MASK>

USR:Oh, I feel so stupid! My card expired in 2019

USR:That's why it's not working

USR:I'm so sorry with bothering you with this

SYS:I am very sorry I am doing the best I can

SYS:I will notify the internal web team

ACT:<SENT_MASK>

SYS:What were you searching for?

USR:boots by <MASK> <MASK>.

SYS:I can make this purchase for you if you'd like

SYS:<SENT_MASK>

<|endoftext|>SYS:Hi, How can I help you today?

USR:Hello, I am having an issue with the website. Whenever I try to search for a product it lags out and gives me the spinning wheel of death.

SYS:I see, I apologize for this, one moment please as I figure this out for you.

USR:<SENT_MASK>

SYS:So basically the website is very slow, correct?

USR:<SENT_MASK>

SYS:Got it, I am going to notify the internal team of this issue.

ACT:<SENT_MASK>

SYS:Can you try logging in and out of your account to see if that does anything?

USR:Sure one moment

USR:It did not seem to help at all

ACT:<SENT_MASK>

SYS:I see, there are a couple more things we can try.

SYS:If you visit another website is it slow as well?

ACT:<SENT_MASK>

USR:Let me see.. yeah I guess Google is a bit slow as well

SYS:Ah, my apologies but then this must be an issue with your internet and not the AcmeCorp website.

USR:Alright, I will try again later on.. thanks anyway

SYS:No problem, is there anything else I

SYS:I can help you with today!

USR:Nope, that should do it

SYS:Great, don't hesitate to contact acmecorp with any future issues.

SYS:<SENT_MASK>

USR:<SENT_MASK>

<|endoftext|>SYS:Hi how can I help you today?

USR:<SENT_MASK> I want some information about the membership levels. I am considering buying some things and would like to know more about membership.

SYS:Sure thing, can I get your first name, to better address you?

USR:Sanya

SYS:Thanks Sanya! Let me find that info for you, give me one second.

ACT:<SENT_MASK>

ACT:<SENT_MASK>

SYS:So we have three membership levels. They are Bronze, <MASK>, and Gold.

SYS:We try to keep it simple here, unlike some stores that use confusing terms like Platinum, Super exclusive, etc.

USR:Ok. Can you tell me what benefits and rewards are associated with each level?

SYS:<SENT_MASK> All members get an invitation to the annual holiday extravaganza with an open bar and free flights from anywhere in the US. <MASK> members get reduced shipping fees and promo codes.

SYS:<MASK> members get the same as bronze, plus agents can make purchases on their behalf and they can cancel orders at anytime.

SYS:Gold members get all the previous, plus unlimited refunds and benefit of the doubt in any and all transactions.

USR:<SENT_MASK> Do any of the levels receive free shipping? I am interested in free shipping because I plan on ordering many things.

SYS:I can't actually see anywhere where it says specifically free shipping, but there are reduced shipping fees at the <MASK> level and above.

USR:How much is shipping reduced?

ACT:<SENT_MASK>

ACT:<SENT_MASK>

SYS:I can't actually see that here unfortunately, I think it depends on the quantity of items ordered and the overall order price.

USR:<SENT_MASK> Can you tell me how I become a member?

SYS:A percentage of that will be reduced depending on member level.

ACT:<SENT_MASK>

ACT:<SENT_MASK>

SYS:Sure, you earn it by making repeated purchases over a period of time. If you have made more than $500 worth of purchases within the last year, you qualify for <MASK>.

SYS:<MASK> is for $1000, and Gold is for $2000.

USR:Good. You have answered all my questions for today. <SENT_MASK>

USR:Huh?

SYS:Okay, it looks like we will have to cancel the order.

USR:So what do I do when I receive the order since it's already <MASK>? Should I refuse delivery?

SYS:No, I'd accept delivery. If you'd like to return the item for a full refund, then you can.

ACT:<SENT_MASK>

USR:I'd keep it if I could just get the shipping reimbursed. Could I get a refund of just the shipping?

ACT:<SENT_MASK>

USR:Hi there, I'm thinking about buying some boots, and I was wondering if you could give me more info as far as what the lace color is. Is it black or dark brown?

SYS:<SENT_MASK> <SENT_MASK>

USR:<SENT_MASK> It's <MASK> <MASK>.

SYS:<SENT_MASK> Let me get that information for you.

ACT:<SENT_MASK>

ACT:<SENT_MASK>

USR:<SENT_MASK>

ACT:FAQ answer related to boots (other2) was selected.

SYS:Okay, <MASK>. So we use a very high-end leather for our boots and 90% of the boots are black. To go along with the boot color the laces are also black. Black has been deemed more stylish for this season. However...

SYS:some of them are designed to wear a bit so they will have a dark brown touch over time. You can find on our website which products will wear like that.

SYS:Is there any other information I can help you with today?

USR:Oh I see! Okay that answers my question then. That's the only question I had for you; thank you so much for answering it for me. <SENT_MASK>

ACT:<SENT_MASK>

SYS:Let me check the system about the subscription.

SYS:You keep them during the grace period.

USR:<SENT_MASK>

SYS:<SENT_MASK>

USR:But the late fees begin immediately? Then after five days I lose my benefits? I just want to make sure I understand

SYS:YOu have a grace period of 5 days then are charged $2 per day late

USR:And when do I lose my benefits?

USR:Or do I keep them?

SYS:Yes because you no longer have an active subscription

USR:So I lose my benefits after five days?

SYS:I am sorry, there is nothing I can do about this particular situation. I can offer you a discount code for a future purcahse.

USR:Well, I guess that would work. And I really would like for you to pass along my complaints to someone who might be able to do something about it.

USR:I am seeking more information on a jacket I purchased.

SYS:<SENT_MASK>

ACT:<SENT_MASK>

USR:It seems there is a stain, would you know how i remove that?

SYS:Let me check for you!

ACT:<SENT_MASK>

SYS:Is it a wine stain?

USR:Yes, how did you know?

USR:<SENT_MASK>

SYS:It happens a lot, believe it or not. These are great cocktail party jackets.

SYS:I'll help you get that stain out, to the best of my ability.

SYS:Start with a wet cotton cloth, and dab it gently all over the stained area.

SYS:Afterwards, sprinkle salt on the area, and let it sit for 5+ minutes, so that it absorbs all of the excess water.

SYS:Then, pour some boiled water onto it, which will help flush out the stain.

SYS:Lastly, put the jacket in the laundry on the hottest setting of the washer to get rid of any residual marks.

SYS:To dry it, you can line dry it, or use a low-heat dryer.

SYS:<SENT_MASK>

USR:That's great information. <SENT_MASK>

USR:no that was all.

SYS:<SENT_MASK>

SYS:Okay, have a wonderful rest of the day!

SYS:<SENT_MASK> Please give me a moment to look into the price discrepancy.

USR:<SENT_MASK>

USR:That's so frustrating

SYS:However, I am able to offer you a 10% discount code as a one time courtesy.

USR:<SENT_MASK>

ACT:<SENT_MASK>

USR:Well 10% won't cover the price increase

USR:So you haven't really fixed it

<|endoftext|>SYS:<SENT_MASK> <SENT_MASK>

USR:I want to know the return policy.

SYS:Sure, one moment, please.

ACT:<SENT_MASK>

ACT:<SENT_MASK>

ACT:<SENT_MASK>

SYS:It depends on your membership level. If you are a <MASK> member, you get unlimited returns.

SYS:Silver members can return purchases from the past 6 months, and bronze members can return products purchased in the last 90 days.

SYS:All other members can return up to 30 days after their purchase.

USR:<SENT_MASK>

SYS:Can I answer any other questions for you or help with anything else?

USR:<SENT_MASK>

USR:Hey, I forgot my password, so I cannot access my account.

USR:I need information on an order.

SYS:don't worry we will give you a new one

SYS:<SENT_MASK>

USR:<SENT_MASK>

SYS:additional to this you would give me your email, to sent the reset link

USR:<MASK>

SYS:sorry, I need your username, not your email.

SYS:<SENT_MASK>

ACT:Details of <MASK> have been entered.

USR:That's ok, I figured that's what you meant.

USR:I'm thinking of ordering from you, but before I do, I need to know your refund policy.

SYS:<SENT_MASK>

USR:<SENT_MASK>

SYS:<SENT_MASK> <SENT_MASK>

ACT:<SENT_MASK>

ACT:<SENT_MASK>

SYS:Okay you just want to know our refund policy correct?

USR:<SENT_MASK>

SYS:<SENT_MASK> Refunds are available for items before they have been shipped.

SYS:They can be issued with an Order ID, email, and username

SYS:So it's best to get that information together before contacting us.

SYS:We can help you recover a username if needed though

SYS:<SENT_MASK>

USR:Mostly. That means I can't get a refund after something's been shipped?

SYS:After it's been shipped, we technically will just have you return the order instead of refunding it

SYS:So you can still get your money back if you are unhappy

USR:That makes sense. Guess that's all I needed.

USR:<SENT_MASK>

SYS:Your welcome, glad I can help

ACT:<SENT_MASK>

SYS:Okay, looking at the information the laces are going to be black.

SYS:<SENT_MASK>

ACT:<SENT_MASK>

ACT:<SENT_MASK>

USR:For the boots by Tommy_Hilfiger that cost $89, how would I remove gum from the sole

SYS:It's pretty easy, thankfully! First you want to get a glob of peanut butter on a butter knife and rub it over the gum. Let it sit for 10 or 15 minutes, depending how how soft the gum was to start with.

SYS:Once the gum kind of melds with the peanut butter, scrape it off. Then clean your shoe with soap and water to get rid of any remaining peanut butter or gum.

USR:Do you have any alternate methods if I do not have peanut butter?

SYS:Peanut butter is the only method that would not void the warranty, I'm sorry.

USR:Hello and good day. I was wondering if your company does embroidery of names on clothing and such?

ACT:<SENT_MASK>

ACT:<SENT_MASK>

SYS:We do! But the cost depends. Stitching costs 30 cents PER character for the first 15. 20 for the next 15, and 10 per any other ones.

USR:Is that per entire order or a single line of embroidery?

ACT:<SENT_MASK>

SYS:The entire order runs using that method.

USR:so if I have ten different items with the same basic name for each the price will be reduced for the characters after 30 characters regardless of how many garments I order?

SYS:<SENT_MASK>

SYS:Anything else I may help you with today by chance?

USR:Hmm, no I don't think so, thank you so very much for explaining all of it to me.

ACT:<SENT_MASK>

USR:So I saw this amazing <MASK> jacket on your site

USR:It costs only $84 and it looks soooo cool

USR:I live on the road (traveling saleswoman)

USR:And I often lack access to a washing machine

USR:Do you know how often the jacket needs to be washed?

ACT:<SENT_MASK>

SYS:<SENT_MASK> If you are going to wear it regularly, plan on washing it at least twice each season it is worn. If it's a jacket you'll only wear every once in a while, once a season is fine.

USR:So, like, if I wear it on all my sales calls this spring

USR:I should wash it twice during the spring?

SYS:Exactly!

USR:<SENT_MASK>

USR:I can probably manage that while traveling

SYS:Let me look that up and see what I can find. <SENT_MASK>

ACT:<SENT_MASK>

ACT:<SENT_MASK>

USR:<SENT_MASK>

SYS:David, our shirts are made of 100% natural fibers such as cotton, linen, wool or a blend of these. The most popular blend is 90% cotton and 10% linen. The label on the collar will tell you what material is used.

USR:Ah that is perfect. I would also like to know how to ash the shirt.

SYS:You could always order one and wee if it bothers you and return it if it doesn't work for you.

USR:Is there any instructions?

ACT:<SENT_MASK>

USR:That's a good idea, maybe I'll try that.

SYS:You can throw it in the washer with your other clothes and was as you normally would. It is recommended to use color guard with bleach to preserve the color.

SYS:Drying should be on permanent press if possible, but it is not required.

SYS:Is there anything else you needed to know today?

USR:No I think you answered my questions. <SENT_MASK>
