USR:it's the calvin klein jacket

ACT:Searching the FAQ pages ...

ACT:System Action: search jacket

USR:I'm curious how easy it would be to take out stains like wine or paint?

SYS:Quite easy, actually.

SYS:From our knowledge base:

SYS:To remove a wine stain from the jacket, wet a cotton cloth and gently dab it on the stained area. Then, sprinkle some salt on the area and let it sit for five minutes or more, absorbing the excess water.

SYS:Next, pour some boiled water on the area to flush out the stain. Finally, you can launder the jacket with the hottest water setting to completely remove any residual marks. When drying, either line dry the jacket or use a low-heat dryer.

USR:salt? hmm I would have never thought of it
