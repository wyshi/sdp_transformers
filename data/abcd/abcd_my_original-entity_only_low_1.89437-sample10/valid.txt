ACT:System Action: search boots

USR:if there's a good way to do it without ruining the leather yeah

SYS:After that then you just use soap and water.

<|endoftext|>SYS:Hello. How can I help you today?

USR:hi, can you please check on my subscription status? I don't want it to end

SYS:Okay, so you just want to make sure it's active?

SYS:Or do you want to know when it's due?

USR:that's what I'm checking with you about

SYS:Which one of those do you want to know?

USR:I want to pay it if I need to

USR:you can't see that?

SYS:Okay, so you are here to pay bill - and not to check if it's active, or if it's due?

SYS:Nope, I don't have any sort of account pulled up

USR:and you can't?

SYS:I just want to clarify what the problem is so I can nail down the correct process.

SYS:I can, but I won't know what to do/where to check unless I understand what it is you need.

SYS:So - is your primary objective to 1) pay your bill, 2) find out how much is due for your subscription, or 3) find out if your subscription is active?

SYS:Each of those leads down a slightly different path.

USR:I have a subscription for your premium service...I don't want it to expire...I don't want it to lapse and I want to pay it if I need to...can't explain it much better than that

SYS:I know, it is confusing and it probably just seems, from your end, like all the same stuff. Unfortunately our process is a bit convoluted.

USR:you may need a better system?

SYS:Maybe :) Just a moment please

USR:okay

USR:this is taking quite a long time

USR:maybe I should just stick with Amazon

SYS:I am sorry to hear that, I am just trying to ensure I know how to handle your query appropriately.

USR:we can do that in our system, and I have worked retail for years

SYS:I can't over-ride the price. As our algorithm cannot be changed. I can offer you a promo code however, to use on any future order.

ACT:A promo code has been created.

USR:no, that is pretty lame, actually

USR:surely someone there can do something, after all, you asked me about the price from yesterday

SYS:I asked about the price from yesterday because it is a common issue. However I cannot change it back to yesterday, there is nothing else I can do besides give a promo code that likely covers the extra cost anyway.

SYS:Very sorry for the issue, is there anything else I can help you with today?

USR:no, and I will just not place the order.  It doesn't show ordered, correct?

SYS:Correct. You can just simply not order it, and the promo code can be used whenever you like within the next 7 days if you find something else you want.

USR:so the promo code is usable even if I don't order the shirt?

SYS:Correct.

USR:oh wow, well, I was just thinking what a crappy day...  thanks

SYS:No worries let me look that up for you

ACT:Searching the FAQ pages ...

ACT:System Action: search boots

ACT:FAQ answer related to boots (how1) was selected.

SYS:Well our best advice is to first brush off the excess paint

SYS:Then use a coarser brush to get off as much dried paint as possible

SYS:Apply a soapy mixture to the area, and that should soften the paint enough to scrape it off

SYS:Then you should rub the area with a detergent and finish with nail polish remover.

SYS:That should get any and all paint off the boot.

USR:Okay.  I will try that.  Thank you!

SYS:No worries. Is there anything else you need?

USR:That is all for today

SYS:Then have a nice day!

<|endoftext|>USR:Hello

SYS:Hi, how may I help you today?

USR:I am very upset and I need help

SYS:Oh dear, I will do my best to help you.

SYS:What's going on?

USR:I keep going on your site to try to buy things. But too many of the best items are always out of stock. I don't understand what is going on!

USR:I used to love your site, but it's really gone downhill lately. I am very upset and angry

USR:If this continues, I won't bother shopping with you anymore

SYS:I definitely understand your frustration.

SYS:I hope that we can figure out a solution, because we would hate to lose our relationship with you.

USR:Why are so many things out of stock??

USR:This never used to happen

USR:Yes, you would lose a wonderful customer

SYS:What's your full name please?

USR:Chloe Zhang

ACT:Account has been pulled up for Chloe Zhang.

SYS:Thanks Chloe. I am not positive, but if I were to speculate, I would imagine with the current state of affairs with COVID 19, that a lot more people have time at home to shop and there are fewer people who are able to work along our supply chain.

USR:I guess that would make sense

SYS:That is, fewer people fulfilling orders, making items, delivering, et c.

USR:But stores like you need to step up during this difficult time and help people

USR:We still have to wear clothes, you know

SYS:I will reach out to our purchasing department to let them know about your dissatisfaction, first and foremost.

USR:All right

USR:I would appreciate that

ACT:The purchasing department has been notified.

USR:Is there anything else you can do to help?

SYS:I will write a report for them, so that they know where they can improve the experience for customers like you.

SYS:I can offer you a promo code.

SYS:I know it won't help today, given that so many items are out of stock.

USR:Right

USR:I suppose I could hold onto it for later, though

USR:I would like the promo code

SYS:However, we update the online inventory almost daily (not so much on weekends), so you should start seeing the items you want back on the site again.

USR:Okay. I will keep that in mind and I will check later for more items

SYS:The codes are generally good for 7 days, so you won't need to rush to buy today.

ACT:A promo code has been created.

SYS:Your code is W2CCL

USR:Maybe as this situation continues you'll adapt to our new reality

USR:Thank you

USR:I'll hold onto that code for later

SYS:I hope so, I definitely agree that we need to keep with the times and continue to evolve for our wonderful customers like yourself.

SYS:I hope that your issue with us was resolved satisfactorily.

USR:Well, your excellent customer service has helped restore my faith in this company
