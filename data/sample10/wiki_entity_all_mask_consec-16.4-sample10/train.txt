 On <MASK> , the <MASK> 's <MASK> entered <MASK> , taking the city without much resistance before fierce <MASK> air attacks caused the division heavy losses . Still , it was able to surround the ROK 3rd Division in the city . By now , <MASK> and <MASK> had been reduced to a combined strength of <MASK> @,@ 500 men to the ROK 3rd Divisions ' <MASK> @,@ <MASK> . The <MASK> massed its force again to assist <MASK> in surrounding and besieging the ROK 3rd Division , which was trapped in the city . <MASK> , in the meantime , was ordered to remain in the city to delay the <MASK> as long as possible . It was eventually evacuated by sea after delaying <MASK> forces for a considerable time . The rugged terrain of the mountains prevented the <MASK> forces from conducting the enveloping maneuvers they had used so effectively against other troops , and their advantages in numbers and equipment had been negated in the fight . 
 By <MASK> , the division was still embroiled in this fight and the <MASK> bypassed it and moved toward <MASK> on the left flank of the city . However the <MASK> had suffered significant setbacks at <MASK> , with substantial losses due to <MASK> and <MASK> naval artillery fire . Once it arrived in the area , it met heavier resistance from <MASK> police and militia operating in armored vehicles . With air support , they offered the heaviest resistance the unit had faced thus far . With the support of <MASK> of <MASK> regiments , the <MASK> was unable to sustain its advance , and had to pull back by <MASK> . Movement from <MASK> prevented the 766th Regiment from infiltrating further into the mountains . ROK cavalry and civilian police then began isolated counteroffensives against the <MASK> . These forces included special counter @-@ guerrilla units targeting the <MASK> and countering its tactics . <MASK> troops halted the advance of the <MASK> again around the end of the month thanks to increased reinforcements and support closer to the <MASK> logistics network . 
 On <MASK> , the <MASK> 's 12th Division pushed back <MASK> in the Ch 'ongsong @-@ Kigye area , and linked up with elements of the <MASK> which had infiltrated the area of <MASK> . Unopposed , they began to prepare to attack <MASK> 'ohang to secure entry into the <MASK> 's newly established <MASK> . The <MASK> was ordered to begin an attack in coordination with the <MASK> 's <MASK> . <MASK> planned simultaneous offensives across the entire <MASK> , including a flanking maneuver by the 766th and <MASK> to envelop <MASK> troops and push them back to <MASK> . The <MASK> was not reinforced ; <MASK> planners intended it to move unseen around the <MASK> lines while the majority of the <MASK> and <MASK> troops were locked in fighting around Taegu and the Naktong Bulge . 
 By this time , however , <MASK> logistics had been stretched to their limit , and resupply became increasingly difficult . By <MASK> , the <MASK> units operating in the area were getting little to no food and ammunition supply , instead relying on captured <MASK> weapons and foraging for what they could find . They were also exhausted from over a month of advancing , though morale remained high among the <MASK> troops . <MASK> specialized in raiding <MASK> supply lines , and effectively mounted small disruptive attacks against <MASK> targets to equip themselves . 
 
 = = Structure = = 
 
 " Ode to a <MASK> " was probably the <MASK> of the middle set of <MASK> odes that <MASK> wrote following " <MASK> " , according to <MASK> . There is further evidence of this in the structure of the poems because <MASK> combines <MASK> different types of lyrical poetry in an experimental way : the odal hymn and the lyric of questioning voice that responds to the odal hymn . This combination of structures is similar to that in " Ode on <MASK> " . In both poems the dual form creates a sort of dramatic element within the poem . The stanza forms of the poem is a combination of elements from <MASK> sonnets and <MASK> sonnets . 
 When it came to vowel forms , <MASK> incorporated a pattern of alternating historically " short " and " long " vowel sounds in his ode . In particular , line <MASK> ( " And purple @-@ stained mouth " ) has the historical pattern of " short " followed by " long " followed by " short " and followed by " long " . This alteration is continued in longer lines , including line <MASK> ( " Away ! away ! for I will fly to thee " ) which contains <MASK> pairs of alternations . However , other lines , such as line <MASK> ( " Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains " ) rely on a pattern of <MASK> " short " vowels followed by " long " and " short " vowel pairings until they end with a " long " vowel . These are not the only combination patterns present , and there are patterns of <MASK> " short " vowels followed by a " long " vowel in other lines , including <MASK> , <MASK> , and <MASK> , which are repeated twice and then followed up with <MASK> sets of " short " and then " long " vowel pairs . This reliance on vowel sounds is not unique to this ode , but is common to <MASK> 's other <MASK> odes and his <MASK> . 
 The poem incorporates a complex reliance on assonance — the repetition of vowel sounds — in a conscious pattern , as found in many of his poems . Such a reliance on assonance is found in very few <MASK> poems . Within " <MASK> to a <MASK> " , an example of this pattern can be found in line <MASK> ( " Already with thee ! tender is the night " ) , where the " ea " of " Already " connects with the " e " of " tender " and the " i " of " with " connects with the " i " of " is " . This same pattern is found again in line <MASK> ( " I cannot see what flowers are at my feet " ) with the " a " of " cannot " linking with the " a " of " at " and the " ee " of " see " linking with the " ee " of " feet " . This system of assonance can be found in approximately a tenth of the lines of <MASK> 's later poetry . 
 When it came to other sound patterns , <MASK> relied on double or triple caesuras in <MASK> of lines throughout the <MASK> odes . An example from " <MASK> to a <MASK> " can be found within line <MASK> ( " The grass , the thicket , and the fruit @-@ tree wild " ) as the pauses after the commas are a " masculine " pause . Furthermore , <MASK> began to reduce the amount of <MASK> based words and syntax that he relied on in his poetry , which in turn shortened the length of the words that dominate the poem . There is also an emphasis on words beginning with consonants , especially those that begin with " b " , " p " or " v " . These <MASK> consonants are relied on heavily in the <MASK> stanza , and they are used syzygically to add a musical tone within the poem . 
 In terms of poetic meter , <MASK> relies on spondee throughout his <MASK> odes and in <MASK> of his lines within " <MASK> to a <MASK> " , including line <MASK> : 
 and line <MASK> : 
 To <MASK> , the use of spondees in lines <MASK> – 34 creates a feeling of slow flight , and " in the final stanza . . . the distinctive use of scattered spondees , together with initial inversion , lend [ s ] an approximate phonetic suggestion of the peculiar spring and bounce of the bird in its flight . "

 Biographers Fraser and <MASK> wrote that <MASK> has often been credited with gaining the right to vote for <MASK> women . While <MASK> did make radio addresses in support of women 's suffrage and also published articles in her <MASK> newspaper asking male Peronists to support women 's right to vote , ultimately the ability to grant to women the right to vote was beyond <MASK> 's powers . <MASK> and <MASK> claim that <MASK> 's actions were limited to supporting a bill introduced by <MASK> of her supporters , <MASK> , a bill that was eventually dropped . 
 A new women 's suffrage bill was introduced , which the <MASK> of <MASK> sanctioned on <MASK> . It was necessary to wait <MASK> before <MASK> sanctioned it on <MASK> .

In a public celebration and ceremony , however , <MASK> signed the law granting women the right to vote , and then he handed the bill to <MASK> , symbolically making it hers . 
 Eva Perón then created <MASK> , the <MASK> large female political party in the nation . <MASK> and <MASK> write that by <MASK> , the party had <MASK> @,@ <MASK> members and <MASK> @,@ <MASK> headquarters across the country . <MASK> and <MASK> write that while <MASK> did not consider herself a feminist , her impact on the political life of women was decisive . <MASK> of previously apolitical women entered politics because of <MASK> . They were the <MASK> women active in <MASK> politics . The combination of female suffrage and the organization of <MASK> granted <MASK> a large majority ( <MASK> ) of the vote in the <MASK> presidential elections .

 Antimony forms a highly useful alloy with lead , increasing its hardness and mechanical strength . For most applications involving lead , varying amounts of antimony are used as alloying metal . In lead – acid batteries , this addition improves the charging characteristics and reduces generation of unwanted hydrogen during charging . It is used in antifriction alloys ( such as <MASK> metal ) , in bullets and lead shot , cable sheathing , type metal ( for example , for linotype printing machines ) , solder ( some " lead @-@ free " solders contain <MASK> Sb ) , in pewter , and in hardening alloys with low tin content in the manufacturing of organ pipes .
